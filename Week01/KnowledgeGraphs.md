# Knowledge Graphs 
From general lecture of Computerphile for research

- Encode information and knowledge into a graph

London:
-> All places of business
-> all of Address
->etc.

BushHouse has:
- An Address
- Hours open,
- etc.

- All of that data can be extracted from documents
    - see info retrieval

- KG: database that stores facts together in a linked format


Edge: Any type of relation
- Transitivity is implied if relation is the same
- BushHouse (located in)-> London -> (located in)UK
- Therefore BushHouse is located in London

- Based on an ontology (define this)

- Knowledge graph embedding is the task of completing the knowledge graphs by probabilistically inferring the missing arcs from the existing graph structure
